Communication

**1. Team Meetings:**

Our team will meet once a week on Tuesday using Zoom. The purpose of this meeting

will be to look at the work done the week before and then assign work for the following

week. Each week one person can be designated with assigning work, in order of Sarthak,

then Ajay, then Pranav, then Jaylen (more on this in the work distribution section). This

time can also be used to debug code issues if there is extra time. Everyone should be

there for the entire hour but no one has to stay after the hour if they do not want to. The

time slot will be one that works for everyone every week.

**2. Assistance**

Our team has decided that direct phone number communication via text message is the

best way to contact each other regarding getting logistical assistance, scheduling, or

questions, and that zoom meetings are the best means of working on/assisting each other

with regards to the technical-side of our final project. We set an expectation that a basic

response to a text or call should be made within 4 hours, as people cannot check phones

during a lab or class period, and that a thorough response to help with the problem should

be made within 48 hours.

**3. Respect**

As in any successful group, maintaining mutual respect and an encouraging environment

is something we all agreed is vital. To ensure that each member is enabled to share their

opinion, we agreed that each member should provide some sort of input into each

decision (the extent of that input is up to that member), and that everyone should keep

their mics on mute when another member is sharing an idea. Furthermore, we decided to

designate a note-taker for each meeting, so that everyone's ideas are written down and

able to be re-referenced. Finally, we have agreed that although the work will be divided

up, and certain members will be more or less involved in certain aspects of the project as





a whole, all decisions will be cast based on a majority vote. Signing this document

confirms that each member will respect and take responsibility for decisions made by the

team on a majority-vote basis.

Collaboration

**1. Work Distribution Each week:**

Every week, one person will be in charge of figuring out what needs to be done that

week. We will draft deliverables and then have an open discussion on who takes what

part of that week's work. Deciding which team member does what task will be decided as

a result of each team member's strengths and weaknesses, as well as personal preferences.

If a consensus cannot be reached the person who was in charge of figuring out the work

that week can assign people.

**2. Time Commitment:**

So that everyone does an equal amount of work, every single team member will work

around 3-4 hours a week to complete each week’s deliverables. If any part of the project

requires more work for any reason, the added work will be evenly distributed among

team members. Any conflicts in meetings which exist or will arise will be discussed

within a group to find a solution for redistributing the workload.

**3. Conflict Resolution:**

In the instance of a conflict/disagreement arising between members of the team, the team

will actively work to listen to all perspectives/approaches and constructively debate each

argument until a unanimous decision for how to proceed is reached. Such conflicts

include the initial scope/direction of the project, fair/appropriate allocation of work, and

communication issues that impact deadlines of the final project. Ultimately, the goal of

the project is to perform analysis that sparks the interest of each team member and

facilitates an environment in which each member can contribute and grow their technical

applications.
