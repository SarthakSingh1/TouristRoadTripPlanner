START:
We met this week and set the framework for working collaboratively on our project for the next few weeks. 

Data Parsing:
    We initialized our CSV data file, and began converting it into an easily accessible, parseable data. We have dedicated 2/4 team members to implementing the parsed data in a two fold way: Ajay will upload the raw data into a CSV file, then parse it into an excel spreadsheet, while Jaylen will then parse the formatted spreadsheet into the code. The two will then test together to make sure that call commands accurately references the correct lines of data.

Graph/Data structure 
    As a team we also set boundaries and general guidelines for implementing our graph structures and how the weights would be set. Additionally, we also created the framework for how the parsed data structure will be made into a traversal that traverses our graphs in two different ways.

MakeFile and Git
    We began working on the MakeFile Setup (making the files and putting starter code into it), as well as figuring out the test suite and how to incorporate it into the MakeFile. Finally, we have to decide on the best form of working collaboratively, whether through making separate git branches and merging them, working with VSCode Livshare, etc.

DELIVERABLES
    The goals we set to have completed before our next meeting (prior to the mid-project check-in):

Excel sheet with the data we will be using in our final project
Code to parse a CSV file into a C++ program 
The rationale  of why code was parsed into a certain format in a google doc
Ex. We put it into a vector because of _____

Document detailing how we are fulfilling the graph requirements of our project, and how that graph will be used with the algorithms we decided on (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and BFS) to create the final project
