We met 11/30 to discuss progress, goals, and work left to be done. 

Progress in Last Week:
We finished parsing our CSV data and putting that data into a graph object. Now the graph can be represented as an AdjacencyMatrix/ AdjacencyList which has the neighboring attrcations stored as borders, with the weights being the distance between the attractions. 

We just need to finish Dijsktra's Algorithm, BFS, and our visualization of the map. 

We also need to work on the IO for the input and output, and wrap up things for the presentation.
